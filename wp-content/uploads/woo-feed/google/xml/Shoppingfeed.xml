<title><![CDATA[Wild King Salmon Steaks]]></title>
<description><![CDATA[Our wild king salmon steaks have a rich and buttery flavor with soft-textured flakes and a velvety finish.  Also known as chinook, tyee, or blackmouth salmon, king salmon are prized for their high oil content, firm texture, and rich flavor. The fish’s flesh color can range from deep red to pale white, or “ivory.” This prized winter white flesh is only found in about 10% of kings. In most cases, though, buyers should expect a pale pink or orange color from their king salmon.

King Salmon Steaks come with bones in and skin on, which help the fish retain it's moisture and delicious fats and nutrients throughout the cooking process.

King salmon have consistently won blind taste tests among salmon aficionados. Kings are the largest of the species, typically sitting at an average weight between 15 and 20 lbs. The fish’s high oil content makes it a prime candidate for grilling, broiling, sautéing, baking, poaching, steaming, and smoking – almost every salmon preparation will taste good on a king.

For those new to buying wild king salmon online, know that there is a running debate among fish lovers about which is the best salmon – king or sockeye. We have to admit that these wild king salmon portions will give sockeye fans a run for their money.

<h3><strong>Wild King Salmon Preparation Tips</strong><strong> </strong></h3>
As one of the more decadent salmon types, king salmon doesn’t require a lot of effort in the kitchen. The fish’s natural flavor and texture are enough to stand out as a main course. That said, we prefer our king salmon grilled on a cedar plank with a sprinkling of sea salt. To finish squeeze some fresh lemon juice onto the skin with a few twists of freshly ground black pepper. When buying wild king salmon online, we recommend a simple preparation to better experience the fish’s flavor.

<strong> </strong>
<h3><strong>Handling Instructions – Wild King Salmon</strong></h3>
If you buy wild king salmon online from Lummi Island Wild, expect to receive a delivery of frozen, not thawed, fish. All of our king salmon ships frozen in order to preserve the fish’s delicate taste and texture. Once the package is received, you can either begin to defrost your king salmon portions for dinner that evening or keep them frozen for a later meal. King salmon has a higher oil content than other types of fish, which means it will spoil faster. That said, you can safely store it in a freezer for at least six weeks.]]></description>

<title><![CDATA[Wild Coho Salmon Portions]]></title>
<description><![CDATA[Also known as silver salmon, cohos have a red-orange color, with a traditional, rich salmon flavor. Cohos eat other fish as well as zooplankton, and have a slightly stronger salmon flavor than sockeye salmon. An excellent choice for grilling, broiling, sautéing, baking, poaching, steaming, and smoking.

Our wild, coho salmon have really good color, medium texture and flake, and a clean flavor. It's a staple on our local restaurant menus. Our wild coho/ silver salmon fillets are a good alternative to sockeye, and at a lower price.

<title><![CDATA[Wild Coho Salmon Portions]]></title>
<description><![CDATA[Also known as silver salmon, cohos have a red-orange color, with a traditional, rich salmon flavor. Cohos eat other fish as well as zooplankton, and have a slightly stronger salmon flavor than sockeye salmon. An excellent choice for grilling, broiling, sautéing, baking, poaching, steaming, and smoking.

Our wild, coho salmon have really good color, medium texture and flake, and a clean flavor. It's a staple on our local restaurant menus. Our wild coho/ silver salmon fillets are a good alternative to sockeye, and at a lower price.

<title><![CDATA[Alaskan Halibut Roasts 18-22 oz]]></title>
<description><![CDATA[Alaskan Halibut is a lean fish with mild, sweet tasting, pure white flesh, and a firm but tender texture. Halibut retains its moisture well in frozen state and keeps its texture when cooked. Uncooked, the white flesh of halibut should be almost translucent, not dull, yellowish or dried out. When cooked, the snow-white meat loses its glossy appearance and is flaky and tender though still firm.

These 18-22 oz roasts are perfect for 3-4 people, or 2 hungry adults.

<title><![CDATA[Alaskan Halibut 4 oz]]></title>
<description><![CDATA[Alaskan Halibut is a lean fish with mild, sweet tasting, pure white flesh, and a firm but tender texture. Halibut retains its moisture well in frozen state and keeps its texture when cooked. Uncooked, the white flesh of halibut should be almost translucent, not dull, yellowish or dried out. When cooked, the snow-white meat loses its glossy appearance and is flaky and tender though still firm.

These 4 oz portions are perfect for fish and chips or petite portions. *These are small portions cut from our smallest fish.
<h3><strong>HANDLING INSTRUCTIONS - Halibut</strong></h3>
Ships frozen. Skin-on boneless portions. Keep refrigerated for up to 7 days, or keep frozen]]></description>

<title><![CDATA[4 oz Wild King Salmon]]></title>
<description><![CDATA[Our 4 oz petite wild king salmon portions have a rich and buttery flavor with soft-textured flakes and a velvety finish.  Also known as chinook, tyee, or blackmouth salmon, king salmon are prized for their high oil content, firm texture, and rich flavor. The fish’s flesh color can range from deep red to pale white, or “ivory.” This prized winter white flesh is only found in about 10% of kings. In most cases, though, buyers should expect a pale pink or orange color from their king salmon.

King salmon have consistently won blind taste tests among salmon aficionados. Kings are the largest of the species, typically sitting at an average weight between 15 and 20 lbs. The fish’s high oil content makes it a prime candidate for grilling, broiling, sautéing, baking, poaching, steaming, and smoking – almost every salmon preparation will taste good on a king.

For those new to buying wild king salmon online, know that there is a running debate among fish lovers about which is the best salmon – king or sockeye. We have to admit that these wild king salmon portions will give sockeye fans a run for their money.

&nbsp;
<h3><strong>Wild King Salmon Preparation Tips</strong><strong> </strong></h3>
As one of the more decadent salmon types, king salmon doesn’t require a lot of effort in the kitchen. The fish’s natural flavor and texture are enough to stand out as a main course. That said, we prefer our king salmon grilled on a cedar plank with a sprinkling of sea salt. To finish squeeze some fresh lemon juice onto the skin with a few twists of freshly ground black pepper. When buying wild king salmon online, we recommend a simple preparation to better experience the fish’s flavor.

<strong> </strong>
<h3><strong>Handling Instructions – Wild King Salmon</strong></h3>
If you buy wild king salmon online from Lummi Island Wild, expect to receive a delivery of frozen, not thawed, fish. All of our king salmon ships frozen in order to preserve the fish’s delicate taste and texture. Once the package is received, you can either begin to defrost your king salmon portions for dinner that evening or keep them frozen for a later meal. King salmon has a higher oil content than other types of fish, which means it will spoil faster. That said, you can safely store it in a freezer for at least six weeks.]]></description>

<title><![CDATA[Smoked Keta Salmon Fillet]]></title>
<description><![CDATA[Break out our beautiful smoked keta salmon fillets for a crowd pleasing party platter. Nothing artificial here. Just a traditional brine and hardwood smoke. Keta salmon is a classic choice for traditional smoked salmon, because of its texture and oil content.

These fillets are vacuum sealed and ready to eat. Lummi Island Wild is the best place to buy smoked salmon online. We provide free shipping on orders over $99, a money back guarantee, and a fresh delivery guarantee.

Small fillets average 1 lb, large fillets average 1.5 lbs.

&nbsp;
<h3><strong>Exploring Smoked Salmon with Keta</strong><strong> </strong></h3>
Keta salmon is also known as chum, silverbrite, and dog salmon. The fish has a firm texture when compared to other species. Its flesh ranges from light pink to orange, and the flavor is milder than other types of salmon. When compared to other, more expensive options – like king and sockeye salmon – keta provides a different taste experience.

One key difference between salmon species is oil content. King salmon and sockeye have a high oil content, which creates a stronger taste and lighter texture. Keta salmon is a leaner fish, translating to a lighter flavor.  Those who are new to smoked salmon, or folks who want a bit of salmon flavor in a meal, will love our smoked keta wild salmon for its delicate flavor and firm texture.

If you’re in search of the best place to buy smoked salmon online, look no further than Lummi Island Wild.

<strong> </strong>
<h3><strong>Handling Instructions – Smoked Salmon</strong><strong> </strong></h3>
The best place to buy smoked salmon online isn’t necessarily the most expensive retailer. It’s the company who provides a high-quality product. Our smoked wild keta salmon ships frozen but is ready to eat after thawing. Customers can keep this salmon refrigerated for up to 45 days, or keep frozen.

<description><![CDATA[These wild, marbled King salmon are a rare and special treat. The same great quality and rich taste of the "red" king, but with a slight color that varies between red and ivory.  Marbled and Ivory king salmon account for only a fraction of the annual catch and have the same high omega 3 content, and the clean taste that connoisseurs of wild salmon appreciate.

<title><![CDATA[Fish Bone Broth]]></title>
<description><![CDATA[This kit provides seafood lovers with an easy way to order fish bone broth online. Rather than buying pre-made broth, which can be full of preservatives and added sodium, our customers can make their own with Lummi Island Wild discarded fish parts. This kit comes with 5 to 7lbs of salmon heads and bones, allowing you to order fish bone broth online in a way that is both healthy and sustainable.

&nbsp;
<h3><strong>How to Make Fish Bone Broth?</strong></h3>
The best answer to this common question is to avoid store-bought fish bone broth. Instead, make your own stock at home. Until now, the hardest part of the process has been finding a place to buy fish bones and heads. Our fish bone broth kit makes it easy to get everything you need right here.

Before you order your fish bone broth kit online, make sure you have everything you need. In addition to fish parts, you should include a few pounds of vegetables. Most veggies will work, but carrots, celery, potatoes, and onions are traditional. You’ll also need a stock pot large enough to cook everything at once, as well as a mixture of herbs and spices to add flavor.

Once you have everything you need, the actual cooking is simple. Simmer the vegetables in your stock pot for around 20 minutes, then add the fish bones and heads. Submerge everything in water and simmer for around 50 minutes, taking care to avoid overcooking the broth. When done, enjoy warm or freeze into portions to use while cooking stews, soups, and other seafood dishes.

Newer cooks might want more detailed instructions for making fish bone broth. There are a variety of recipes available online, but we prefer <a href="https://drkellyann.com/blogs/recipes/fish-bone-broth">this one from Dr. Kelly Ann</a>. Bon Appétit also has an <a href="https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/easy-fish-stock">easy fish stock recipe</a> that we’ve enjoyed. Don’t bother to order fish bone broth online – making your own is quick and simple.

<strong> </strong>
<h3><strong>Handling Instructions</strong><strong> </strong></h3>
Our fish heads and bones ship frozen to help preserve their flavor. These bones will keep well in the refrigerator for up to seven days, and they can remain frozen for several months. However, we recommend making your broth soon after the delivery arrives. Even if you choose to use the broth later, it’s easier to make and freeze the liquid than to preserve the bones.

Fish bone broth is extraordinarily easy to cook on your own. If you have the scraps and bones necessary to make it, you won’t need to order fish bone broth online – just make it yourself. You’ll be sure to taste the difference.]]></description>

<title><![CDATA[Baker King Salmon Portions]]></title>
<description><![CDATA[Salmon’s flavor is directly related to how much fat is in the fish. As a result, Baker king wild salmon--with its high fat content--has our highest recommendation for both salmon lovers and skeptics alike. Its superior fat content will provide an eating experience that is second to none. These are some of the most impressive and spectacular king salmon we’ve ever tasted. If you’re deciding on which fish to try, we highly recommend this wild salmon shipped from us.

These kings are caught by Upper Skagit tribal fishing families who live, bleed, and slush ice the fish for us. By working the waters with local independent fishers who respect both salmon and our environment, we can ensure the highest quality wild kings available. These are orca safe king salmon, which means they are caught with sustainable gear with little or no bycatch. The fishery is also carefully co-managed by the tribe, so you can feel great about supporting this provider.

Plus, this is a micro fishery that is limited to only 500 fish. Don’t miss an opportunity to eat the best king salmon of the season, and have some Baker King wild salmon shipped today.
<h3><strong>Salmon Preparation Tips</strong><strong> </strong></h3>
You don’t need to put much effort into preparing salmon this decadent. We prefer a simple sear with some butter and herbs, but home chefs can also bake, roast, grill, and pan fry to suit individual tastes. The fat in king salmon means this is a very forgiving fish for novice cooks, so there is no need to feel intimated by this salmon.
<h3><strong>Handling Instructions – Baker King Wild Salmon</strong></h3>
Baker king wild salmon is shipped in 6-ounce boneless and skin-on portions. The fish will be frozen when it arrives. If you plan to enjoy the fish that day, we recommend thawing in the refrigerator. This particular salmon has high fat content, which means it will spoil faster than other types of salmon. Don’t wait too long to enjoy.]]></description>

<title><![CDATA[Sablefish (Black Cod) Fillets]]></title>
<description><![CDATA[You’re in for a treat when you order sablefish online from Lummi Island Wild. Our Sablefish (Black Cod) is also known as butterfish – a nickname that aptly describes its richness. Caught in waters nearly 2,500 ft. deep, we source our black cod off Alaska’s pristine coast using just a hook and line. The fillets we prepare are boneless and skin-on, and they typically weigh around 1.25 lbs.

&nbsp;
<h3><strong>Tips for Preparing Sablefish</strong></h3>
If you’re new to sablefish, here’s a traditional <a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/recipes/black-cod-miso"><strong>Black Cod with Miso recipe</strong></a> from Food &amp; Wine. A signature at many sushi and fish restaurants, this sweet-savory dish has been cloned by chefs all over the world. The recipe creator, Nobu Matsuhisa, marinates the black cod in the sake-miso marinade for two to three days. If you don’t want to wait that long between when you order sablefish online and when you can eat your catch, the fish is also spectacular with a quick, overnight marinade – just enough time to coat the skin in sake and miso.

If you’re in the mood for a lighter, simpler sablefish preparation, we recommend a quick pan sear. Butterfish is delicious when blackened. To do this, heat olive oil over medium-high heat in a large skillet. Season the fish with some salt and pepper, then cook skin-side down for between 4 and 5 minutes. Turn the fish over and cook for another 2 to 3 minutes, then allow to rest.

<strong> </strong>
<h3><strong>Handling Instructions – Black Cod</strong><strong> </strong></h3>
Customers who order sablefish online from Lummi Island Wild can expect skin-on and boneless fillets. Our fish ships frozen, which helps preserve the meat’s flavor and texture. When you order sablefish online from us, expect it to be packed and shipped with dry ice to maintain a safe temperature.

Once the fish arrives, you can allow it to thaw and keep refrigerated for up to 7 days. If you want to save your Alaskan Black Cod fillets for a special occasion, they will stay good while frozen for around two months. Keep in mind that sablefish has a higher fat content than other types of seafood, which means it will spoil faster, even when frozen.]]></description>

Customers who order sablefish online from Lummi Island Wild can expect skin-on and boneless fillets. Our fish ships frozen, which helps preserve the meat’s flavor and texture. When you order sablefish online from us, expect it to be packed and shipped with dry ice to maintain a safe temperature.

Once the fish arrives, you can allow it to thaw and keep refrigerated for up to 7 days. If you want to save your Alaskan Black Cod fillets for a special occasion, they will stay good while frozen for around two months. Keep in mind that sablefish has a higher fat content than other types of seafood, which means it will spoil faster, even when frozen.]]></description>

<title><![CDATA[Sablefish (Black Cod) Fillets]]></title>
<description><![CDATA[You’re in for a treat when you order sablefish online from Lummi Island Wild. Our Sablefish (Black Cod) is also known as butterfish – a nickname that aptly describes its richness. Caught in waters nearly 2,500 ft. deep, we source our black cod off Alaska’s pristine coast using just a hook and line. The fillets we prepare are boneless and skin-on, and they typically weigh around 1.25 lbs.

&nbsp;
<h3><strong>Tips for Preparing Sablefish</strong></h3>
If you’re new to sablefish, here’s a traditional <a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/recipes/black-cod-miso"><strong>Black Cod with Miso recipe</strong></a> from Food &amp; Wine. A signature at many sushi and fish restaurants, this sweet-savory dish has been cloned by chefs all over the world. The recipe creator, Nobu Matsuhisa, marinates the black cod in the sake-miso marinade for two to three days. If you don’t want to wait that long between when you order sablefish online and when you can eat your catch, the fish is also spectacular with a quick, overnight marinade – just enough time to coat the skin in sake and miso.

If you’re in the mood for a lighter, simpler sablefish preparation, we recommend a quick pan sear. Butterfish is delicious when blackened. To do this, heat olive oil over medium-high heat in a large skillet. Season the fish with some salt and pepper, then cook skin-side down for between 4 and 5 minutes. Turn the fish over and cook for another 2 to 3 minutes, then allow to rest.

<title><![CDATA[Bulk Smoked Wild Sockeye]]></title>
<description><![CDATA[Many people ask us what's in personal refrigerators... well -- this is it! All the flavor -at a fraction of the cost, and no guilt when we keep going back for more.

<title><![CDATA[Alaskan Coho Fillets]]></title>
<description><![CDATA[These wild coho salmon are hook &amp; line caught in Southeast Alaska. Cleaned, catheter-bled, and fresh-frozen as they come out of the sea. Simply put, these are the freshest coho salmon you can eat.
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>“Epic quality – right up there with Reefnet caught salmon”</em> - Lummi Island Wild Crew</p>
It is with great pride we introduce new partner fishers Joel &amp; Tele on the F/V Nerka. “<em>Driven by quality rather than quantity and with minimal by-catch, trolling is a beautifully inefficient fishery. That’s what we love about it.</em>”- Tele &amp; Joel.

You can see why they're our kind our fishers. Slow food style, quality focused, and troll-caught Alaskan coho salmon are a “Best Choice” seafood from Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch.

Tele and Joel shared more of their story with us: “For coho salmon we move inland, where the cold, clean North Pacific pounds a rocky shoreline crowned with a spruce-scented, seemingly endless green: the Tongass, the world’s largest remaining temperate rainforest, “America’s Salmon Forest.” Our companions are humpback whales and herring, brown bears and bald eagles, albatross and orca. This glorious ecosystem, meticulously stewarded with decades of strict conservation-based fisheries management, cultivates abundant salmon stocks. Every day, we marvel at the remarkable gift of having grown up doing this work, giving thanks for the salmon-loving friends who help us make fishing our life.”

More info: Also known as silver salmon, cohos have a red-orange color, with a traditional, rich salmon flavor. Coho eat other fish as well as zooplankton, and have a slightly stronger salmon flavor than sockeye salmon. An excellent choice for grilling, broiling, sautéing, baking, poaching, steaming, and smoking.

<title><![CDATA[Alaskan Coho Fillets]]></title>
<description><![CDATA[These wild coho salmon are hook &amp; line caught in Southeast Alaska. Cleaned, catheter-bled, and fresh-frozen as they come out of the sea. Simply put, these are the freshest coho salmon you can eat.
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>“Epic quality – right up there with Reefnet caught salmon”</em> - Lummi Island Wild Crew</p>
It is with great pride we introduce new partner fishers Joel &amp; Tele on the F/V Nerka. “<em>Driven by quality rather than quantity and with minimal by-catch, trolling is a beautifully inefficient fishery. That’s what we love about it.</em>”- Tele &amp; Joel.

You can see why they're our kind our fishers. Slow food style, quality focused, and troll-caught Alaskan coho salmon are a “Best Choice” seafood from Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch.

Tele and Joel shared more of their story with us: “For coho salmon we move inland, where the cold, clean North Pacific pounds a rocky shoreline crowned with a spruce-scented, seemingly endless green: the Tongass, the world’s largest remaining temperate rainforest, “America’s Salmon Forest.” Our companions are humpback whales and herring, brown bears and bald eagles, albatross and orca. This glorious ecosystem, meticulously stewarded with decades of strict conservation-based fisheries management, cultivates abundant salmon stocks. Every day, we marvel at the remarkable gift of having grown up doing this work, giving thanks for the salmon-loving friends who help us make fishing our life.”

More info: Also known as silver salmon, cohos have a red-orange color, with a traditional, rich salmon flavor. Coho eat other fish as well as zooplankton, and have a slightly stronger salmon flavor than sockeye salmon. An excellent choice for grilling, broiling, sautéing, baking, poaching, steaming, and smoking.

<description><![CDATA[Alaskan Halibut is a lean fish with mild, sweet tasting, pure white flesh, and a firm but tender texture. Halibut retains its moisture well in frozen state and keeps its texture when cooked. Uncooked, the white flesh of halibut should be almost translucent, not dull, yellowish or dried out. When cooked, the snow-white meat loses its glossy appearance and is flaky and tender though still firm.

Caught in Southeast Alaska on the F/V Middleton.

<title><![CDATA[Dungeness Cooked Crab]]></title>
<description><![CDATA[Dungeness crabs are a seafood lover’s staple. These crabs have moist, naturally sweet meat, making them a popular choice for both seafood lovers and skeptics. As a helpful point of reference, some say Dungeness crab meat tastes like that of a Maine lobster, but more tender. And, like lobster, these crustaceans travel well, making it easy to order Dungeness crab online.

The Dungeness crabs from Lummi Island Wild are pre-cooked and frozen, nearly eliminating the need for any additional preparation. Each order comes with three crabs, each ranging from 1.75 to 2lbs. For best results, we recommend thawing your crabs in the refrigerator, then placing them in a pot of unsalted boiling water for 4 minutes.

&nbsp;
<h3><strong>Dungeness Crab Recipe Tips</strong></h3>
Crabs are an incredibly versatile type of seafood. These pre-cooked crustaceans are great in crab cocktails, crab cakes, pastries, stuffed pastas, crab eggs benedict — you get the idea. Plus, because the crustaceans are already cooked, there are few opportunities to make mistakes. The meat is delicious both on its own or cooked into a recipe, so when you orderDungeness crab online you have an easy path to the freshest seafood meal.

Crab cakes are an easy and traditional preparation, and if you’re new to Dungeness crab, we suggest starting here. Our crab cake recipe philosophy is simple: don’t ruin the delicate meat with unnecessary fillers. Pictured above, you’ll find a family recipe card from my Aunt Gin. Her recipe dates back around 40 years. It’s a classic crab cake recipe without no fillers – just seasoning, sauces, herbs, and an egg. As you can see in the picture, these are “The Best” crab cakes you’ll ever make.

<strong> </strong>
<h3><strong>Handling Instructions – Whole Cooked Dungeness Crab</strong><strong> </strong></h3>
When you order Dungeness crab online from Lummi Island Wild, they will ship frozen directly from the source. Because they are pre-cooked, home chefs won’t have much trouble preparing the crabs. Simply thaw them on the counter or in the refrigerator, then boil for around 4 minutes. If you are ordering Dungeness crab online in advance of a special occasion, they will remain safe in the freezer for up to four months.]]></description>

<title><![CDATA[Dungeness Cooked Crab]]></title>
<description><![CDATA[Dungeness crabs are a seafood lover’s staple. These crabs have moist, naturally sweet meat, making them a popular choice for both seafood lovers and skeptics. As a helpful point of reference, some say Dungeness crab meat tastes like that of a Maine lobster, but more tender. And, like lobster, these crustaceans travel well, making it easy to order Dungeness crab online.

The Dungeness crabs from Lummi Island Wild are pre-cooked and frozen, nearly eliminating the need for any additional preparation. Each order comes with three crabs, each ranging from 1.75 to 2lbs. For best results, we recommend thawing your crabs in the refrigerator, then placing them in a pot of unsalted boiling water for 4 minutes.

&nbsp;
<h3><strong>Dungeness Crab Recipe Tips</strong></h3>
Crabs are an incredibly versatile type of seafood. These pre-cooked crustaceans are great in crab cocktails, crab cakes, pastries, stuffed pastas, crab eggs benedict — you get the idea. Plus, because the crustaceans are already cooked, there are few opportunities to make mistakes. The meat is delicious both on its own or cooked into a recipe, so when you orderDungeness crab online you have an easy path to the freshest seafood meal.

Crab cakes are an easy and traditional preparation, and if you’re new to Dungeness crab, we suggest starting here. Our crab cake recipe philosophy is simple: don’t ruin the delicate meat with unnecessary fillers. Pictured above, you’ll find a family recipe card from my Aunt Gin. Her recipe dates back around 40 years. It’s a classic crab cake recipe without no fillers – just seasoning, sauces, herbs, and an egg. As you can see in the picture, these are “The Best” crab cakes you’ll ever make.

<title><![CDATA[Smoked Salmon Chowder]]></title>
<description><![CDATA[Our first-ever Smoked Wild Salmon Chowder is new to our seafood lineup and already making a splash. Handcrafted in small batches, the chowder is made with <a href="https://liwcheckout.wpengine.com/product-category/wild-salmon/">Lummi Island Wild Reefnet Salmon</a>, cream, and fresh ingredients, including red potatoes, organic corn, onions, and celery. Naturally gluten free and simply delicious, we promise this will be the best salmon chowder you can order online. The chowder is packaged in shelf-stable pouches and can be heated in the microwave or on the stove top.

Customers who order salmon chowder from Lummi Island Wild say it’s among the best they’ve tried. Chowder can be purchased in packages of 5 or 10 pouches. One pouch is 9 ounces, or a perfect single serving.
<h3><strong>How to Prepare Smoked Wild Salmon Chowder</strong><strong> </strong></h3>
If you order salmon chowder from Lummi Island Wild, prepare for a comforting blend of tastes and textures. Cooking our chowder is as easy as heating up soup. This chowder is packaged in single-serving pouches. When you’re ready to eat, simply spoon the chowder into a saucepan and heat on the stove until warm. You can also transfer the chowder into a microwave-safe bowl or container and heat for several minutes.

Some prefer to prepare this chowder with milk or cream, stirring the dairy into the pot as it warms. If you want a slightly silkier consistency, we recommend trying this technique to thin the soup. Around ¼ cup of milk should do the trick, but let your preference be the guide.

No matter which heating option you choose, simply serve and enjoy once warmed to your liking. We like to eat ours with seeded crackers or crusty bread.
<h3><strong>Handling Instructions</strong></h3>
Our smoked salmon chowder is shelf stable and requires no specialized handling. Like our other non-perishable foods, it is normally shipped via Ground and scheduled to arrive within 3 to 7 business days. You will need to refrigerate pouches after opening, but we don’t anticipate this being a problem – the chowder is so delicious that you’ll be reaching for a second serving. You’ll never order salmon chowder from anywhere else.]]></description>

You can also transfer the chowder into a microwave-safe bowl or container and heat for several minutes.

Some prefer to prepare this chowder with milk or cream, stirring the dairy into the pot as it warms. If you want a slightly silkier consistency, we recommend trying this technique to thin the soup. Around ¼ cup of milk should do the trick, but let your preference be the guide.

No matter which heating option you choose, simply serve and enjoy once warmed to your liking. We like to eat ours with seeded crackers or crusty bread.
<h3><strong>Handling Instructions</strong></h3>
Our smoked salmon chowder is shelf stable and requires no specialized handling. Like our other non-perishable foods, it is normally shipped via Ground and scheduled to arrive within 3 to 7 business days. You will need to refrigerate pouches after opening, but we don’t anticipate this being a problem – the chowder is so delicious that you’ll be reaching for a second serving. You’ll never order salmon chowder from anywhere else.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[Our Orca Safe, wild king salmon have a rich buttery fresh flavor, nice flake and nice finish. Clean tasting because every fish is individually handled, immediately slush iced, and custom processed. Working the waters with local independent fishers who respect both salmon and our environment, we ensure the highest quality wild king salmon available. There is a running debate among fish lovers about which is the best salmon – king or sockeye. You be the judge!

Also known as chinook, tyee, or blackmouth, this fish is prized for its high oil content, firm texture and rich flavor. The color of the flesh can range from deep red to white, or “ivory” -which is found in about 10% of kings. King salmon have consistently won blind taste tests among salmon aficionados. Kings are the largest of the species with their average weight in the Salish Sea being 15-20 lbs. Its high oil content makes it a prime candidate for grilling, broiling, sautéing, baking, poaching, steaming, and smoking. Our kings are caught by tribal fishers, who live bleed and slush ice them for us.

<title><![CDATA[Reefnet Wild Sockeye Portions]]></title>
<description><![CDATA[Reefnet sockeye portions have a chart topping omega-3 fat content. This season,  it's a record breaking 21.5%. Superior fat content makes for great flavor and mouthfeel and you will feel great eating healthy, wild sockeye from a truly sustainable source. You will never go back to eating ordinary salmon after you try our reefnet sockeye.
<h3>WHAT SETS REEFNET SALMON APART?</h3>
Flavor in salmon is directly related to how much fat it has. When a salmon leaves the ocean to return to its natal stream, it stops eating and must rely on stored fat for the remainder of its life as it makes its journey home. The further the salmon must travel to spawn, and the mightier its river of origin, the more fat it will have genetically developed and stored so it can make its most important life sustaining journey home.

<description><![CDATA[Reefnet sockeye portions have a chart topping omega-3 fat content. This season,  it's a record breaking 21.5%. Superior fat content makes for great flavor and mouthfeel and you will feel great eating healthy, wild sockeye from a truly sustainable source. You will never go back to eating ordinary salmon after you try our reefnet sockeye.
<h3>WHAT SETS REEFNET SALMON APART?</h3>
Flavor in salmon is directly related to how much fat it has. When a salmon leaves the ocean to return to its natal stream, it stops eating and must rely on stored fat for the remainder of its life as it makes its journey home. The further the salmon must travel to spawn, and the mightier its river of origin, the more fat it will have genetically developed and stored so it can make its most important life sustaining journey home.

<description><![CDATA[You are about to enjoy an albacore tuna experience like no other, sashimi grade tuna -- in a can.

We are dedicated to offering you the highest quality seafood from truly sustainable sources. Troll caught in the coastal waters of the Pacific Northwest. This fishery has the highest sustainability rating by Seafood Watch.

All of our albacore tuna is sashimi grade before being canned. We use small fish so it's the healthiest tuna available, having more omega 3 fatty acids than most salmon. Use it anywhere you would use fine tuna, including salads, sandwiches, and casseroles. It should be everyone’s pantry staple for a fast, healthy meal.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[Our Reefnet Wild Keta Salmon has a firm texture, subtle orange-pink color and mild flavor. In recent years, keta have been accepted into the fresh market as a center of the plate ingredient. Tracy On, Patagonia’s corporate chef, offers it at the main campus lunch cafe all year long. It is a staple for chowders and fish and chips, and makes an excellent smoked salmon.

<title><![CDATA[Organic Heirloom Blueberry Powder]]></title>
<description><![CDATA[A purple superfood with a concentrated antioxidant punch.  Add this sweet and tangy powerhouse to smoothies, baked goods, grains, salads, spice blends.  Makes a great healthy decoration.  High in fiber, potassium, manganese, iron, and vitamins A and C.  Boost everything! Free radicals don’t stand a chance.

Ingredients: The skins of 2000 Organic blueberries in every 8 oz bag.  Nothing more.

<strong>Bow Hill Blueberries</strong> - This small family owned blueberry farm is located in the heart of the Skagit Valley. It is the oldest family run blueberry farm in Skagit County. While other farms have torn out their heirloom bushes for varieties conducive to machine picking, Harley and Susan Soltes decided to stay small, and to carefully attend to each of their 4500 bushes, converting them to Certified Organic. They studied the characteristics of each of the four varieties they grow, and utilize each in different value-added products that best allow each berry to shine.

Bow Hill Blueberries are very much like Lummi Island Wild. They do not deal in commodity quantities, but like us harvest the berries BY HAND, something all but unheard of in 2017. By their careful handling and stewardship, they allow us to experience the very best that a blueberry can be.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[Coon Stripes are an abundant shrimp found in the Salish Sea, and an alternative to Spot Prawns. While smaller (30-40/lb), they are sweet and delicate, with good texture. We freeze and glaze them whole. They can be eaten raw, boiled, or sautéed.
<h3>FISHERMAN’S TIP -BY RILEY STARKS</h3>
These go well cooked with lots of garlic. In a hot cast iron skillet add a couple of tablespoons of olive oil, add the shrimp, then cook a couple of minutes on each side until the shells are opaque. Toss with chopped garlic and serve.]]></description>

<title><![CDATA[Albacore Tuna Loins]]></title>
<description><![CDATA[Our sushi-grade albacore tuna loins are delivered to your door and make a fast and healthy omega-3 rich meal. These boneless tuna loins can be enjoyed raw or cooked, depending on your preference. This buttery, decadent fish is excellent seared rare, but it also makes for a wonderful addition to a sushi plate.

No matter which preparation you choose, we guarantee a high-quality experience. Each tuna is blast-frozen at sea just minutes after being caught. This helps to preserve its taste and texture. The tuna remains frozen until it reaches your kitchen. When you get albacore tuna loins delivered from Lummi Island Wild, you can feel secure that they are never thawed – even during processing.

&nbsp;
<h3><strong>Fisherman’s Tip – By Riley Starks</strong><strong> </strong></h3>
<em>“For Japanese style sashimi, using a very sharp knife, slice the tuna into thin slices that are translucent. For best results, cut the loin while still partially frozen. Garnish with ginger and wasabi or Italian carpaccio style with lemon, capers and a good olive oil.”</em>

<strong> </strong>
<h3><strong>Handling Instructions – Tuna Loins</strong><strong> Delivered</strong></h3>
When you have our albacore tuna loins delivered to your door, they will arrive vacuum-sealed and frozen in a refrigerated box. Once thawed, they’ll be ready to eat – sashimi style. If you prefer cooked fish, you can prepare to your ideal taste. If you’ve never prepared tuna yourself, we recommend a simple sear on your stovetop. This is a great way to preserve the fish’s natural flavor while adding some delicious heat and texture.

If you’re cooking albacore tuna for the first time, do your best to avoid overcooking the loins. Quick, high heat is the secret to a moist tuna steak – try anything else and you risk a dry piece of meat. Remember that tuna will continue to cook for several minutes once removed from the heat, so be conservative in your timing.

We recommend cooking them over medium-high heat for between 6 and 9 minutes. You’ll know it’s cooked when the fish begins to flake when tested with a fork but remains pink in the center.

Our tuna ships frozen. When your albacore tuna loins are delivered, keep them refrigerated for up to 7 days. If you prefer to save your purchase for later, the tuna will remain fresh for around two months when kept frozen.

<description><![CDATA[Our tuna ventresca is the prized belly meat of our albacore tuna. 3.75 oz can - packed with albacore tuna, a pinch of sea salt, and nothing else. High in omega-3 fatty acids, with a rich flavor. Suitable for special uses such as hors d’oeuvres

You are about to enjoy an albacore tuna experience like no other, sashimi grade tuna — in a can.

All of our albacore tuna is sashimi grade before being canned. We use small fish so it’s the healthiest tuna available, having more omega 3 fatty acids than most salmon. Use it anywhere you would use fine tuna, including salads, sandwiches, and casseroles. It should be everyone’s pantry staple for a fast, healthy meal.

We are dedicated to offering you the highest quality seafood from truly sustainable sources. Troll caught in the coastal waters of the Pacific Northwest. This fishery has the highest sustainability rating by Seafood Watch.]]></description>

<title><![CDATA[Wild Coho - Silver Salmon Fillets]]></title>
<description><![CDATA[Also known as silver salmon, cohos have a red-orange color, with a traditional, rich salmon flavor. Cohos eat other fish as well as zooplankton, and have a slightly stronger salmon flavor than sockeye salmon. An excellent choice for grilling, broiling, sautéing, baking, poaching, steaming, and smoking.

Our coho salmon fillets have really good color, medium texture and flake, and a clean flavor. It's a staple on our local restaurant menus. Our wild coho/ silver salmon fillets are a good alternative to sockeye, and at a lower price.

<title><![CDATA[Alaskan Wild Sockeye Portions]]></title>
<description><![CDATA[Sockeye salmon straight from the pristine waters of Alaska.  These fish have a fresh, clean flavor and are high in omega 3's.

Also known as red salmon,  sockeyes are known for their rich flavor, with their dramatic color remaining during cooking. Sockeye are suitable for grilling, broiling, sautéing, baking, poaching, steaming, and smoking. Sockeye are grazers of the oceans, eating from the bottom of the food chain. Their diet consists of zooplankton, which gives them their deep red color and also their distinctive clean flavor.

<title><![CDATA[Baker Lake Wild Sockeye Portions]]></title>
<description><![CDATA[These wild sockeye portions are highly recommended by all of us at Lummi Island Wild. Their superior fat content makes for great flavor and mouthfeel. They have deep red color and a nice flake and are among the richest in omega 3 fatty acids of any salmon. Healthy for you, healthy for the planet.

Harvested by Upper Skagit and Swinomish Tribal families, these sockeye are the last wild sockeye remaining in the lower Salish Sea, and are the truly amazing success story of multiple tribes working together to save them from extinction. They are a perfect example of “eat them to save them”, as they are a mainstay of the Upper Skagit and Swinomish Tribal families.

Also known as red salmon, sockeye are known for their rich flavor, with their dramatic color remaining during cooking. They are suitable for grilling, broiling, sautéing, baking, poaching, steaming, and smoking. Sockeyes are grazers of the oceans, eating from the bottom of the food chain. Their diet consists of zooplankton, which gives them their deep red color and also their distinctive clean flavor. Baker Lake sockeye have good color, a fatty salmon flavor, and a luxurious mouthfeel.

<description><![CDATA[These wild sockeye portions are highly recommended by all of us at Lummi Island Wild. Their superior fat content makes for great flavor and mouthfeel. They have deep red color and a nice flake and are among the richest in omega 3 fatty acids of any salmon. Healthy for you, healthy for the planet.

Harvested by Upper Skagit and Swinomish Tribal families, these sockeye are the last wild sockeye remaining in the lower Salish Sea, and are the truly amazing success story of multiple tribes working together to save them from extinction. They are a perfect example of “eat them to save them”, as they are a mainstay of the Upper Skagit and Swinomish Tribal families.

Also known as red salmon, sockeye are known for their rich flavor, with their dramatic color remaining during cooking. They are suitable for grilling, broiling, sautéing, baking, poaching, steaming, and smoking. Sockeyes are grazers of the oceans, eating from the bottom of the food chain. Their diet consists of zooplankton, which gives them their deep red color and also their distinctive clean flavor. Baker Lake sockeye have good color, a fatty salmon flavor, and a luxurious mouthfeel.
<h3>Handling Instructions - Wild Sockeye</h3>
Ships frozen. Keep refrigerated for up to 7 days, or keep frozen.

<title><![CDATA[Wild King Salmon Fillets]]></title>
<description><![CDATA[Our wild king salmon have a rich buttery fresh flavor, nice flake and nice finish. Clean tasting because every fish is individually handled, immediately slush iced, and custom processed. Working the waters with local independent fishers who respect both salmon and our environment, we ensure the highest quality wild king salmon available. There is a running debate among fish lovers about which is the best salmon – king or sockeye. You be the judge!

Also known as chinook, tyee, or blackmouth, this fish is prized for its high oil content, firm texture and rich flavor. The color of the flesh can range from deep red to white, or “ivory” -which is found in about 10% of kings. King salmon have consistently won blind taste tests among salmon aficionados. Kings are the largest of the species with their average weight in the Salish Sea being 15-20 lbs. Its high oil content makes it a prime candidate for grilling, broiling, sautéing, baking, poaching, steaming, and smoking. Our kings are caught by tribal fishers, who live bleed and slush ice them for us.

<title><![CDATA[Reefnet Wild Pink Salmon]]></title>
<description><![CDATA[Think of Pink Salmon as the very best trout you have ever eaten.  They live just two years in the Bering Sea, eating from the bottom of the food chain, before returning to their native river. Pinks are delicate and require superior handling after being caught.  There is no other fishery that can bleed and immediately slush ice -one at a time, any volume of Pinks. Our wild pinks are without a doubt, the very highest quality pink salmon available anywhere.

<strong>Details</strong>:

Our wild pinks are without a doubt, the very highest quality pink salmon available anywhere.

<title><![CDATA[Baker Lake Wild Sockeye Fillets]]></title>
<description><![CDATA[These wild sockeye fillets are highly recommended by all of us at Lummi Island Wild. Their superior fat content makes for great flavor. They have deep red color and a nice flake and are among the richest in omega 3 fatty acids of any salmon. Healthy for you, healthy for the planet.

Also known as red salmon, sockeye are known for their rich flavor, with their dramatic color remaining during cooking. They are suitable for grilling, broiling, sautéing, baking, poaching, steaming, and smoking. Sockeyes are grazers of the oceans, eating from the bottom of the food chain. Their diet consists of zooplankton, which gives them their deep red color and also their distinctive clean flavor. Baker Lake sockeye have good color, a fatty salmon flavor, and a luxurious mouthfeel.

Harvested by Upper Skagit and Swinomish Tribal families, these sockeye are the last wild sockeye remaining in the lower Salish Sea, and are the truly amazing success story of multiple tribes working together to save them from extinction. They are a perfect example of “eat them to save them”, as they are a mainstay of the Upper Skagit and Swinomish Tribal families.
<h3>Handling Instructions - Wild Sockeye</h3>
Ships frozen. Keep refrigerated for up to 7 days, or keep frozen.

<description><![CDATA[Our spot shrimp, also call spot prawns, are caught by Lummi Nation tribal fishers working the deep, cold water of the Salish Sea. They are some of the best we have ever tasted with a sweet, buttery flavor beyond Dungeness crab or lobster. The Lummi are the Lhaq’temish, the People of the Sea. The tribe has fished these waters since time immemorial. For Lummis, fishing is more than a living, it’s a way of life. We are proud to partner with quality focused tribal fishing families to offer you these frozen fresh, wild spot prawns.

Thaw spot prawns under refrigeration immediately before use. For best result remove desired quantity of shrimp from resealable bag and place in refrigerated bowl to thaw.
<h3>FISHERMAN’S TIP -BY RILEY STARKS</h3>
These go well cooked with lots of garlic. In a hot cast iron skillet add a couple of tablespoons of olive oil, add the prawns, then cook a couple of minutes on each side until the shells are opaque. Toss with chopped garlic and serve.]]></description>

These go well cooked with lots of garlic. In a hot cast iron skillet add a couple of tablespoons of olive oil, add the prawns, then cook a couple of minutes on each side until the shells are opaque. Toss with chopped garlic and serve.]]></description>

<title><![CDATA[Spot Prawn Tails]]></title>
<description><![CDATA[Our spot shrimp, also call spot prawns, are caught by Lummi Nation tribal fishers working the deep, cold water of the Salish Sea. They are some of the best we have ever tasted with a sweet, buttery flavor beyond Dungeness crab or lobster. The Lummi are the Lhaq’temish, the People of the Sea. The tribe has fished these waters since time immemorial. For Lummis, fishing is more than a living, it’s a way of life. We are proud to partner with quality focused tribal fishing families to offer you these frozen fresh, wild spot prawns.

Thaw spot prawns under refrigeration immediately before use. For best result remove desired quantity of shrimp from resealable bag and place in refrigerated bowl to thaw.

<title><![CDATA[Sablefish (Black Cod) Steaks]]></title>
<description><![CDATA[The highest-quality, fresh black cod delivered to your door can be found right here. This decadent, buttery fish, aptly nicknamed “butterfish,” is a great option for a weeknight dinner, a special event, or a neighborhood cookout. The fish has a smooth, velvety texture with large flakes, and the milky white fillets look beautiful against seared black skin.

Our sablefish is caught at a depth of nearly 2,500 ft. off the pristine Alaskan coast. Plus, the black cod from Lummi Island Wild has a “best choice” rating from the <a href="https://www.seafoodwatch.org/seafood-recommendations">Monterey Bay Aquarium’s SeaWatch</a><strong>.</strong> This means our sablefish is sourced in a way that causes very little harm to habitats and other wildlife.

The steaks are bone-in and skin-on, a solid value for an elegant dinner. When you order fresh black cod delivered to your home from Lummi Island Wild, you’re guaranteed to have a wonderful meal.

&nbsp;
<h3><strong>Tips for Preparing Black Cod Steaks</strong><strong> </strong></h3>
Sablefish has a high fat content, making it an ideal fish for smoking. The meat’s natural oils ensure it won’t lose any flavor or texture in the process. If you’re in the mood for something a bit simpler, pan-roasted black cod is an easy, delicious option.

Some who have our fresh black cod delivered might have an eye toward tradition. Historically, black cod has been cooked with miso and sake. If you’re interested in trying this preparation, here’s a traditional <a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/recipes/black-cod-miso"><strong>Black Cod with Miso recipe</strong></a> from Food &amp; Wine. This is a signature plate at sushi restaurants around the world; the sweet-savory fish dish has been cloned by chefs from California to Australia. The recipe’s author, Nobu Matsuhisa, marinates the black cod in a good deal of the sake-miso marinade for two to three days. This fish is also spectacular if you marinate it only overnight in just enough sake and miso to coat.

&nbsp;
<h3><strong>Handling Instructions – Black Cod</strong><strong> </strong></h3>
Our fresh black cod is delivered frozen. The steaks are bone-in and skin-on. If you thaw the fish, it will stay good in a refrigerator for up to 7 days. If you choose to keep the fish frozen, it will keep in a freezer for around two months. Keep in mind that sablefish’s high fat content means it will spoil faster than other types of fish.]]></description>

<title><![CDATA[Wild King Salmon]]></title>
<description><![CDATA[Our wild king salmon portions have a rich and buttery flavor with soft-textured flakes and a velvety finish.  Also known as chinook, tyee, or blackmouth salmon, king salmon are prized for their high oil content, firm texture, and rich flavor. The fish’s flesh color can range from deep red to pale white, or “ivory.” This prized winter white flesh is only found in about 10% of kings. In most cases, though, buyers should expect a pale pink or orange color from their king salmon.

King salmon have consistently won blind taste tests among salmon aficionados. Kings are the largest of the species, typically sitting at an average weight between 15 and 20 lbs. The fish’s high oil content makes it a prime candidate for grilling, broiling, sautéing, baking, poaching, steaming, and smoking – almost every salmon preparation will taste good on a king.

For those new to buying wild king salmon online, know that there is a running debate among fish lovers about which is the best salmon – king or sockeye. We have to admit that these wild king salmon portions will give sockeye fans a run for their money.

&nbsp;
<h3><strong>Wild King Salmon Preparation Tips</strong><strong> </strong></h3>
As one of the more decadent salmon types, king salmon doesn’t require a lot of effort in the kitchen. The fish’s natural flavor and texture are enough to stand out as a main course. That said, we prefer our king salmon grilled on a cedar plank with a sprinkling of sea salt. To finish squeeze some fresh lemon juice onto the skin with a few twists of freshly ground black pepper. When buying wild king salmon online, we recommend a simple preparation to better experience the fish’s flavor.

<strong> </strong>
<h3><strong>Handling Instructions – Wild King Salmon</strong></h3>
If you buy wild king salmon online from Lummi Island Wild, expect to receive a delivery of frozen, not thawed, fish. All of our king salmon ships frozen in order to preserve the fish’s delicate taste and texture. Once the package is received, you can either begin to defrost your king salmon portions for dinner that evening or keep them frozen for a later meal. King salmon has a higher oil content than other types of fish, which means it will spoil faster. That said, you can safely store it in a freezer for at least six weeks.]]></description>

<h3><strong>Wild King Salmon Preparation Tips</strong><strong> </strong></h3>
As one of the more decadent salmon types, king salmon doesn’t require a lot of effort in the kitchen. The fish’s natural flavor and texture are enough to stand out as a main course. That said, we prefer our king salmon grilled on a cedar plank with a sprinkling of sea salt. To finish squeeze some fresh lemon juice onto the skin with a few twists of freshly ground black pepper. When buying wild king salmon online, we recommend a simple preparation to better experience the fish’s flavor.

<strong> </strong>
<h3><strong>Handling Instructions – Wild King Salmon</strong></h3>
If you buy wild king salmon online from Lummi Island Wild, expect to receive a delivery of frozen, not thawed, fish. All of our king salmon ships frozen in order to preserve the fish’s delicate taste and texture. Once the package is received, you can either begin to defrost your king salmon portions for dinner that evening or keep them frozen for a later meal. King salmon has a higher oil content than other types of fish, which means it will spoil faster. That said, you can safely store it in a freezer for at least six weeks.]]></description>

<title><![CDATA[Wild King Salmon]]></title>
<description><![CDATA[Our wild king salmon portions have a rich and buttery flavor with soft-textured flakes and a velvety finish.  Also known as chinook, tyee, or blackmouth salmon, king salmon are prized for their high oil content, firm texture, and rich flavor. The fish’s flesh color can range from deep red to pale white, or “ivory.” This prized winter white flesh is only found in about 10% of kings. In most cases, though, buyers should expect a pale pink or orange color from their king salmon.

King salmon have consistently won blind taste tests among salmon aficionados. Kings are the largest of the species, typically sitting at an average weight between 15 and 20 lbs. The fish’s high oil content makes it a prime candidate for grilling, broiling, sautéing, baking, poaching, steaming, and smoking – almost every salmon preparation will taste good on a king.

For those new to buying wild king salmon online, know that there is a running debate among fish lovers about which is the best salmon – king or sockeye. We have to admit that these wild king salmon portions will give sockeye fans a run for their money.

<title><![CDATA[Alaskan Coho Portions]]></title>
<description><![CDATA[These wild coho salmon are hook &amp; line caught in Southeast Alaska. Cleaned, catheter-bled, and fresh-frozen as they come out of the sea. Simply put, these are the freshest coho salmon you can eat.

<em>“Epic quality – right up there with Reefnet caught salmon”</em> – Lummi Island Wild Crew

It is with great pride we introduce new partner fishers Joel &amp; Tele on the F/V Nerka. “<em>Driven by quality rather than quantity and with minimal by-catch, trolling is a beautifully inefficient fishery. That’s what we love about it.</em>”- Tele &amp; Joel.

You can see why they’re our kind of fishers. Slow food style, quality focused, and troll-caught Alaskan coho salmon are a “Best Choice” seafood from Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch.

Tele and Joel shared more of their story with us: “For coho salmon we move inland, where the cold, clean North Pacific pounds a rocky shoreline crowned with a spruce-scented, seemingly endless green: the Tongass, the world’s largest remaining temperate rainforest, “America’s Salmon Forest.” Our companions are humpback whales and herring, brown bears and bald eagles, albatross and orca. This glorious ecosystem, meticulously stewarded with decades of strict conservation-based fisheries management, cultivates abundant salmon stocks. Every day, we marvel at the remarkable gift of having grown up doing this work, giving thanks for the salmon-loving friends who help us make fishing our life.”

More info: Also known as silver salmon, cohos have a red-orange color, with a traditional, rich salmon flavor. Coho eat other fish as well as zooplankton, and have a slightly stronger salmon flavor than sockeye salmon. An excellent choice for grilling, broiling, sautéing, baking, poaching, steaming, and smoking.

<title><![CDATA[Smoked Wild Keta Salmon]]></title>
<description><![CDATA[Our Smoked Wild Keta Salmon is perfect for picnics, car trips, sporting events, and everything in between. We take our wild-caught Keta, and hot smoke it over alder coals. The result is a delicious, complex smoked salmon sure to improve any dish – from bagels and lox to pastas and salads.

These 4 oz portions are vacuum sealed and ready to eat. They make a great healthy snack for people on the go and a fine ingredient over pasta for dinner. Plus, Lummi Island Wild is the best place to buy smoked salmon online. We provide free shipping on large orders, a money back guarantee, and a fresh delivery guarantee.

&nbsp;
<h3><strong>Exploring Smoked Salmon with Keta</strong><strong> </strong></h3>
Keta salmon has a strange reputation among seafood lovers. Also known as chum, silverbrite, and dog salmon, the fish has a firmer and coarser texture than other species. Its flesh ranges from light pink to orange, and the flavor is milder than other types of salmon. When compared to other, more expensive options – like king and sockeye salmon – keta provides a slightly different experience.

However, this does not mean keta salmon is of a lower quality. The difference between salmon types is oil content. King salmon has a high oil content, which creates a stronger taste and lighter texture. Keta salmon has a lower oil content, resulting in a leaner fish. This translates to a lighter flavor, which has its own benefits. Those who are new to smoked salmon, or folks who want a bit of salmon flavor in a meal, will love our smoked keta wild salmon for its delicate flavor and firm texture.

An excellent addition to any meal, our smoked wild keta salmon is perfect for seafood lovers and skeptics alike. If you’re in search of the best place to buy smoked salmon online, look no further than Lummi Island Wild.

<strong> </strong>
<h3><strong>Handling Instructions – Smoked Salmon</strong><strong> </strong></h3>
The best place to buy smoked salmon online isn’t necessarily the most expensive retailer. It’s the company who provides a high-quality product. Our smoked wild keta salmon ships frozen but is ready to eat after thawing. Customers can keep this salmon refrigerated for up to 45 days and longer in the freezer.

&nbsp;
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
Keta Salmon, Sea Salt, Brown Sugar, Hardwood Smoke.]]></description>

<title><![CDATA[Smoked Wild Sockeye Salmon]]></title>
<description><![CDATA[The secret to our Smoked Wild Sockeye is simple. We start with the highest quality sockeye salmon, which is sourced humanely and sustainably. We add a bit of salt and a light alder smoke to retain moisture, then let the smoke do its thing. Our smoked salmon delivery helps make picnics, car or bicycle trips, and sporting events even tastier with high quality fish. You name the activity and smoked salmon will only improve your experience.

&nbsp;
<h3><strong>Ideas for Cooking with Smoked Salmon</strong></h3>
Smoked fish is a remarkably versatile ingredient. Sure, you can eat it with bagels and cream cheese, but we like to get creative with our smoked salmon. Shred the fish over hot pasta, add it to a salad, or use it to top your scrambled eggs. This smoked salmon is also delicious as a blended dip, when baked into a brandade, or shredded into fritters. Smoked sockeye flavor is beautifully complemented by fennel, carrots, pea shoots, cucumbers, asparagus, chicory, and white grapefruit, among others. If you’re looking for inspiration, we recommend <a href="https://www.bonappetit.com/recipes/slideshow/smoked-fish">this resource from Bon Appétit</a>.

Sockeye is among the best types of salmon for smoking. The high oil content allows the fish to absorb the smoke, resulting in a fuller-bodied taste profile. While often compared to king salmon, sockeye is often the better choice for smoking. The flesh is somewhat denser than king salmon, allowing it to stay firm during the smoking process.

No matter how you use it, this smoked sockeye makes for an easy but elegant dinner. Plus, it’s certified Kosher.

<strong> </strong>
<h3><strong>Handling Instructions – Smoked Salmon</strong><strong> </strong></h3>
Like our other wild salmon, this smoked sockeye salmon ships frozen to preserve the meat’s flavor and texture. After a few hours spent thawing, you’ll be ready to eat. This salmon can stay in the refrigerator for up to 45 days and even longer in the freezer.

Each portion is around 4 ounces, and customers can buy between 1 and 24 portions in a single container. Our smoked salmon delivery makes excellent gifts for friends and family, but we won’t judge if you keep it all for yourself.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[The secret to our Smoked Wild Sockeye is simple. We start with the highest quality sockeye salmon, which is sourced humanely and sustainably. We add a bit of salt and a light alder smoke to retain moisture, then let the smoke do its thing. Our smoked salmon delivery helps make picnics, car or bicycle trips, and sporting events even tastier with high quality fish. You name the activity and smoked salmon will only improve your experience.

&nbsp;
<h3><strong>Ideas for Cooking with Smoked Salmon</strong></h3>
Smoked fish is a remarkably versatile ingredient. Sure, you can eat it with bagels and cream cheese, but we like to get creative with our smoked salmon. Shred the fish over hot pasta, add it to a salad, or use it to top your scrambled eggs. This smoked salmon is also delicious as a blended dip, when baked into a brandade, or shredded into fritters. Smoked sockeye flavor is beautifully complemented by fennel, carrots, pea shoots, cucumbers, asparagus, chicory, and white grapefruit, among others. If you’re looking for inspiration, we recommend <a href="https://www.bonappetit.com/recipes/slideshow/smoked-fish">this resource from Bon Appétit</a>.

Sockeye is among the best types of salmon for smoking. The high oil content allows the fish to absorb the smoke, resulting in a fuller-bodied taste profile. While often compared to king salmon, sockeye is often the better choice for smoking. The flesh is somewhat denser than king salmon, allowing it to stay firm during the smoking process.

No matter how you use it, this smoked sockeye makes for an easy but elegant dinner. Plus, it’s certified Kosher.

<strong> </strong>
<h3><strong>Handling Instructions – Smoked Salmon</strong><strong> </strong></h3>
Like our other wild salmon, this smoked sockeye salmon ships frozen to preserve the meat’s flavor and texture. After a few hours spent thawing, you’ll be ready to eat. This salmon can stay in the refrigerator for up to 45 days and even longer in the freezer.

Each portion is around 4 ounces, and customers can buy between 1 and 24 portions in a single container. Our smoked salmon delivery makes excellent gifts for friends and family, but we won’t judge if you keep it all for yourself.]]></description>

<title><![CDATA[Alaskan Weathervane Scallops]]></title>
<description><![CDATA[Having Weathervane scallops delivered to your door is an easy way to ensure a delicious, simple meal. These white, solid, sweet, and buttery Alaska Weathervane Scallops are harvested and processed on board Jim Stone’s catcher and processor. The creamy white and pink shellfish have a sweet, mild taste. These scallops are shucked and frozen within minutes of being caught, locking in their naturally fresh and sweet flavor. Our weathervane scallops are available in 20-ounce bags.

The Weathervane fishery is the exemplary model for sustainable scallop harvesting. The fishing grounds are closely monitored and regulated, and they are moved annually to protect the habitat. The <a href="https://www.msc.org/what-you-can-do/eat-sustainable-seafood/fish-to-eat">Marine Stewardship Council</a> has certified Weathervane as a green fishery.
<h3><strong>Tips for Preparing Scallops</strong><strong> </strong></h3>
Scallops are a popular appetizer, but the versatile seafood works well in a variety of dishes. Weathervane scallops have a sweet, mild flavor, which means we don’t recommend overwhelming the fish with too many ingredients. To make the most of their delicate flavor, quickly pan sear them until they are browned and lightly crusted on the outside. The middle should remain tender. To better taste their natural flavor, serve with a lightly flavored sauce, like white wine, herb, or lemon-butter.

Of course, many scallop preparations include more decadent ingredients. Bacon-wrapped scallops are famous party appetizers, and brown sugar glazes are becoming increasingly popular. This is a very adaptable seafood, which means it can be prepared to suit nearly any taste.

If you have Weathervane scallops delivered from Lummi Island Wild, we want to caution you against overcooking. Scallops have a tendency to get tough and rubbery if exposed to too much heat. Just keep an eye on the burner and on your clock and you should be all set.
<h3><strong>Handling Instructions – Weathervane Scallops</strong><strong> </strong></h3>
The Weathervane scallops delivered from Lummi Island Wild are shipped frozen in 20-ounce bags. This helps to preserve the shellfish’s texture and flavor during the shipping process. If you want to enjoy the scallops when they arrive, let them thaw before cooking. If you prefer to wait, they will remain good to eat in your freezer for up to three months.]]></description>

Just minutes after each catch, the tuna is blast frozen while still at sea, preserving its delicate, succulent texture. Our albacore medallions are then processed while frozen, allowing the fish to retain the best-possible taste for when it eventually reaches your doorstep.

Our sushi-grade albacore tuna makes a fast and healthy omega-3 rich meal. We ship albacore tuna medallions frozen and packaged as boneless, 6-ounce pieces that diners can enjoy either raw or cooked. We like to keep a few packages of medallions in the freezer at home, ensuring we are never more than a few minutes away from a delicious, healthy meal.

<strong> </strong>
<h3><strong>Fisherman’s Tip – By Riley Starks</strong><strong> </strong></h3>
<em>“For Japanese style sashimi, using a very sharp knife, slice the tuna into thin slices that are translucent. For best results, cut the medallions while still partially frozen. Garnish with ginger and wasabi or Italian carpaccio style with lemon, capers and a good olive oil.”</em>

<strong> </strong>
<h3><strong>Handling Instructions – Albacore Medallions</strong><strong> </strong></h3>
We ship albacore tuna medallions packed with dry ice, which helps to maintain a safe temperature. After thawing, they will be ready to eat, sashimi style. If you prefer your tuna cooked, a simple sear is the perfect preparation. Remember that our tuna medallions are shipped frozen, so they may need some time to thaw before you start the grill.

Importantly, you’ll want to keep an eye on the heat and clock when preparing albacore tuna. When seared, grilled, or baked for too long, the fish’s texture can become dry and rubbery. We recommend a quick cook over medium-high heat, between 6 and 9 minutes. The loin medallion center should still be pink, but the outer skin should flake off when tested with a fork.

Once thawed and refrigerated, tuna will stay good for up to 7 days. If you prefer to save your albacore tuna loin medallions for a later date, they can safely remain frozen for around two months.

<title><![CDATA[Salish Sea Halibut]]></title>
<description><![CDATA[Salish Sea halibut is a lean fish with mild, sweet tasting, pure white flesh, and a firm but tender texture. It needs no bacon wrap or sauce to give it flavor. This prized local resource is preferred by our region’s chefs. <a href="http://communityfood.coop/classes/instructor-profiles/nancy-ging/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://communityfood.coop/classes/instructor-profiles/nancy-ging/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1491425101399000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEMs1IcEqCPPhHaCCYkEGcgbnAAjg"><strong><em>Chef Robert Fong</em></strong></a> collaborated with us during a cooking class to see which had better flavor and texture, our frozen Salish Sea Halibut portions or fresh Alaska portions. We cooked side-by-side, all things being equal, and all 26 students and both instructors preferred the Salish Sea halibut!

This halibut is harvested exclusively by tribal fishers in the Salish Sea. For years we’ve known that it is far and away the best halibut we have eaten, but because the tribal season starts the same day the Alaska and Coastal seasons start, there has been no effort to separate it out from the large volume of other halibut that hits the market at the same time. This is only a 3-week season, and then there is no more Salish Sea halibut for another year.

<title><![CDATA[Salish Sea Halibut]]></title>
<description><![CDATA[Salish Sea halibut is a lean fish with mild, sweet tasting, pure white flesh, and a firm but tender texture. It needs no bacon wrap or sauce to give it flavor. This prized local resource is preferred by our region’s chefs. <a href="http://communityfood.coop/classes/instructor-profiles/nancy-ging/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&amp;q=http://communityfood.coop/classes/instructor-profiles/nancy-ging/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1491425101399000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEMs1IcEqCPPhHaCCYkEGcgbnAAjg"><strong><em>Chef Robert Fong</em></strong></a> collaborated with us during a cooking class to see which had better flavor and texture, our frozen Salish Sea Halibut portions or fresh Alaska portions. We cooked side-by-side, all things being equal, and all 26 students and both instructors preferred the Salish Sea halibut!

This halibut is harvested exclusively by tribal fishers in the Salish Sea. For years we’ve known that it is far and away the best halibut we have eaten, but because the tribal season starts the same day the Alaska and Coastal seasons start, there has been no effort to separate it out from the large volume of other halibut that hits the market at the same time. This is only a 3-week season, and then there is no more Salish Sea halibut for another year.

<description><![CDATA[Ikura, salt cured salmon roe, is popular the world over. It is a superfood, very rich in omega 3 fatty acids, and good for brain development and immune systems, especially those of children. Our Smoked Keta Ikura is number 1 quality, smoked for a unique experience not unlike cold smoked lox. Use it as a garnish, a flavor enhancer or a side dish, with salads, soups and hors d’oeuvres. We freeze it immediately after packaging, and it stays frozen, so it should be treated as any fish, with a shelf life of a week after thawing.]]></description>

<description><![CDATA[Ikura, salt cured salmon roe, is popular the world over. It is a superfood, very rich in omega 3 fatty acids, and good for brain development and immune systems, especially those of children. Our Smoked Keta Ikura is number 1 quality, smoked for a unique experience not unlike cold smoked lox. Use it as a garnish, a flavor enhancer or a side dish, with salads, soups and hors d’oeuvres. We freeze it immediately after packaging, and it stays frozen, so it should be treated as any fish, with a shelf life of a week after thawing.]]></description>
